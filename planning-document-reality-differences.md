# Planning Document vs. Reality Differences

This document highlights the differences between the original planning document and the actual implementation of the MCP Random Tables project. It categorizes these differences and provides recommendations on whether the plan or reality should take precedence.

## Domain Layer

### Entities and Value Objects

| Difference         | Plan                                                    | Reality                                                                  | Recommendation                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value Objects      | Only mentioned Range                                    | Implemented Range, RollTemplate, and TemplateReference                   | **Reality**: The additional value objects enhance the functionality and provide better separation of concerns. |
| RollResult Entity  | Basic properties (tableId, entryId, content, timestamp) | Additional properties (isTemplate, resolvedContent)                      | **Reality**: The additional properties support template functionality.                                         |
| RandomTable Entity | Basic roll functionality                                | Enhanced roll functionality with support for ranges and weighted entries | **Reality**: The enhanced functionality provides more flexibility.                                             |

### Template Support

| Difference    | Plan                               | Reality                                                                     | Recommendation                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nested Tables | Listed as future enhancement (v1+) | Basic implementation already exists with RollTemplate and TemplateReference | **Reality**: The early implementation of this feature is beneficial, though it appears to be incomplete (resolveTemplateResult is a placeholder). |

## Secondary Adapters

### Repository Implementation

| Difference           | Plan                     | Reality                             | Recommendation                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Repository Name | FsTableRepository        | FileTableRepository                 | **Reality**: The name is more descriptive and follows common naming conventions. |
| In-Memory Repository | Not explicitly mentioned | InMemoryTableRepository implemented | **Reality**: This provides a useful option for testing and development.          |

### Random Number Generation

| Difference         | Plan                                        | Reality                                          | Recommendation                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RNG Implementation | CryptoRngAdapter using Node's crypto module | DefaultRandomNumberGenerator using Math.random() | **Plan**: Using crypto would provide better randomness for a production system. Consider implementing the planned CryptoRngAdapter. |

## MCP Server Implementation

### Tools and Resources

| Difference          | Plan                       | Reality                                                 | Recommendation                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Weighted Distributions | Listed as future enhancement | Basic implementation exists in RandomTable.roll() | **Reality**: The implementation already supports weighted entries.                                   |
| Conditional Results    | Listed as future enhancement | Not implemented                                   | **Plan**: This remains a valid future enhancement.                                                   |
| Web UI                 | Listed as future enhancement | Not implemented                                   | **Plan**: This remains a valid future enhancement.                                                   |

## Documentation

| Difference         | Plan                         | Reality                                         | Recommendation                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Documentation | Not specifically mentioned   | Thorough JSDoc comments throughout the codebase | **Reality**: The comprehensive documentation improves maintainability. |
| User Documentation | Mentioned as part of Phase 5 | Status unclear from examined files              | **Plan**: Ensure user documentation is completed as planned.           |

## Summary

The actual implementation largely follows the planning document's architecture and goals, with some notable enhancements and adaptations:

1. **Enhanced Domain Model**: The implementation includes additional value objects and entity properties that weren't explicitly mentioned in the plan but enhance the functionality.

2. **Early Implementation of Future Features**: Some features listed as future enhancements (like template support and weighted distributions) have already been partially implemented.

3. **Testing and Documentation**: The implementation includes comprehensive testing and code documentation, which aligns with best practices.

4. **Practical Adaptations**: The implementation makes practical adaptations to the plan, such as using Math.random() instead of crypto for random number generation and adding an in-memory repository for testing.

Overall, the reality of the implementation appears to be a thoughtful extension of the original plan, maintaining its core principles while making practical adaptations and enhancements. In most cases, the reality should take precedence over the plan, as it represents the actual working system with its practical considerations.

However, there are a few areas where the plan's intentions should still be considered:

1. **Random Number Generation**: Consider implementing the planned CryptoRngAdapter for better randomness in production.

2. **Incomplete Features**: Complete the implementation of template resolution and other partially implemented features.

3. **User Documentation**: Ensure comprehensive user documentation is created as planned in Phase 5.
